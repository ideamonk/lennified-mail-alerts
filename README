    This is what empowers http://lenny.in which uses twitter+gmail+oauth to
to get you SMS alerts whenever a new mail arrives.
    I use it on my other gmail account on apps as I usually don't keep checking
it, besides right now I own a simple phone and this is what is allowed in the
10+ hrs I spend in college.

    Have fun.
